# VBA-CDE-Conversion
PDF/Word report to Excel template conversion tool

Developed a Excel VBA automation tool that converts PDF/Word reports into structured, standardized Excel templates. The tool intelligently processes complete documents - including text, tables, images, and embedded objects - while automatically correcting formatting inconsistencies from PDF/Word conversions.

Key Features:

Smart Format Detection: Automatically identifies and processes multiple heading levels, font sizes, and document structures (including numbered lists, bullet points, and appendices)
Flexible Template Support: Handles different output formats with customizable column layouts and styling
Advanced Content Processing: Preserves complex formatting including bold text, underlined content, indentation levels, and hierarchical document structure
Multi-Format Input: Supports .docx, .doc, .pdf and .rtf files with robust error handling
Table & Image Handling: Processes tables as either structured data or images, with automatic scaling and positioning
Intelligent Grouping: Creates collapsible row groups based on document hierarchy for easy navigation

The result is a clean, professionally formatted Excel output that maintains document integrity while enabling easy data manipulation. This automation eliminates hours of manual reformatting.
